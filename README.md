# RxCloudFirestore

RxCloudFirestore is an Rx wrapper around iOS Firestore API that works seamlessly with Codable Protocol in Swift 4.0. The aim of making this library is to improve the developer experience of Google Firestore for those who are already familiar with Reactive Frameworks.

#### Please note
This library is still work-in-progress. Any suggestions or issue reports are welcomed!
